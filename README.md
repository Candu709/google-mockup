# Google Mockup
**A small project based on [this assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css#assignment "Project: Google Homepage") in the foundations path of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) course.**

This is an exercise in deconstructing and rebuilding an existing web page.

## Assignments

- [ ] Build the Google.com homepage
- [ ] Build the Google search result page

## Objectives

The main objectives are to practice:
- Building a page in HTML
- Styling a page using CSS
- Using Git as the local version control manager
- Using GitHub as the remote version control manager

## Development Notes

### No CSS reset/normalize
I avoided using a CSS reset sheet becouse I felt it could fix something that I didnt know or fully understand yet without teaching me much about it.

### Localization
By default I am redirected from google.com to google.it, I decided to recreate this localized version as it has some additional elements (the google store links and the [carbon free banner]() in the footer) that are interesting to place, but translating the texts into English for easier understanding when requesting feedback.  
Later on i might build two different localized pages to practice using altenates version of a page.
